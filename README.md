IOST is a smart contract platform focusing on performance and developer friendliness. Some great features include:

1. The V8 JavaScript engine is integrated inside the blockchain, so you can use JavaScript to write smart contracts!
2. The blockchain is highly scalable with thousands of TPS. Meanwhile it still has a more decentralized consensus than DPoS.
3. 0.5 second block, 0.5 minute finality.
4. Free transactions. You can stake coins to get gas.
